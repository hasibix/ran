ran (pronounced "rAen"), short for "Run Anything Now", is a command-line launcher for games and applications. it uses toml-based application definition files to define how to launch programs and supports features like per-app commands, variables, environment overrides, and more.

ran is useful when you have multiple apps with complex launch arguments and want a reusable, cross-platform configuration.

## features

- launching games and applications from the command line
- toml-based application definition files (`apps/`)
- custom variables per app and global variables (`[vars]`)
- environment overrides (global, per-app and per-command) (`[env]` or `[cmds.<name>.env]`)
- multiple commands per app (`[cmds.<name>]`), `launch` is the default
- cross-platform support (windows and linux)
- application aliases (and alias chaining)
- config directory override via `$RANCFG`
- deriving other apps with `@name_alias_or_fullname [command]` in `cmds.<name>.bin`
- interactive and noninteractive modes

## installation

you can build and install the latest version of ran-launcher from crates.io by running:

```bash
cargo install ran-launcher
# or
cargo install ran-launcher@VERSION # for a specific version
```

or to build and install from source:

```bash
git clone https://codeberg.org/hasibix/ran
cd ran
cargo install --path .
# or
cargo build --release # for just building the executable
```

(make sure you have rust installed to use the commands mentioned above)

alternatively, you can download the latest release from the [releases page](https://codeberg.org/hasibix/ran/releases/latest) and add it to your `PATH`, or run it from the directory you downloaded it into.

> NOTE:
> macOS builds are currently not being released due to complexity of cross-compiling from Linux to macOS. if you're on macOS, you can either use `cargo install` or build from source, which compiles ran on your machine.

---

## usage

to create a new app definition:

```bash
ran app create <full app name, e.g., games/mygame> --edit [--clean]
```

this creates a template toml file in `<config_path>/apps/<full app name>.toml` and opens it in your preferred editor.

after editing the template, save the file and exit. you can now run your app using:

```bash
ran launch <app full name or alias> [args...] [--background]
```

to run a specific command for the app:

```bash
ran cmd <command> <app name> [args...] [--background]
```

---

## examples

### app definition

```toml
[meta]
name = "mygame"
description = "an example game"
version = "0.1.0"

[vars]
DATA_PATH = "/home/user/.mygame"

[env]
PATH = "/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

[cmds.launch]
bin = "mygame_executable"
args = ["--fullscreen", "$DATA_PATH"]
env = { DEBUG = "1" }

[cmds.hello]
bin = "@bash echo" # deriving the `echo` command of the app `bash`
args = ["hello"]

[cmds.debug]
bin = "mygame_executable"
args = ["--windowed", "--debug", "$DATA_PATH"]
```

#### explanation

- `[meta]`: metadata about your app
- `[vars]`: variables that can be used in `args` or `env`
- `[env]`: environment overrides applied when the app runs
- `[cmds.<name>]`: commands you can execute for this app. `launch` is the default
- in `args` or `env`, variables are referenced as `$VAR` or `${nested_var}`

---

## migration (v1.x → v2.x)

if you're coming from an older version of ran, you may want to update your app definitions in order to make them compatible with version 2.x.

you can update your app definition by following the steps mentioned below:

1. move the `exec` table to `cmds.launch`:

```toml
# old
[exec]
bin = "mygame_executable"
args = ["%!"]

# new
[cmds.launch]
bin = "mygame_executable"
args = []
```

2. remove `%!` from `args` if you don't need to specify where CLI arguments would go to.
3. update variable references:

```toml
# old v1.x
args = ["%DATA_PATH%", "%VAR%", "%config.vars.VAR%"]

# new v2.0.0
args = ["$DATA_PATH", "$VAR", "${config.vars.VAR}"] # you can use '$$' for escaping variable expansion
```

4. update variable references in your config file:

```toml
# old
[vars]
MYVAR = "%OTHERVAR%"
OTHERVAR = "%config.interactive%"

# new
[vars]
MYVAR = "$OTHERVAR"
OTHERVAR = "${config.noninteractive}"
# note: config.interactive is now inverted to be config.noninteractive, which is set to false by default
```

additionally, you can add more commands under `[cmds.<name>]`, depending on your use case.

in any case, you can generate/regenerate a new config file by running:

```bash
ran config init [-y/--yes] [-c/--clean] [-e/--edit]
```

## CLI overview

```
ran launch <app name> [args...] [--background]
ran cmd <command> <app name> [args...] [--background]

ran app <subcommand>
ran config <subcommand>
ran alias <subcommand>
ran var <subcommand>
```

examples:

```bash
# launch default command
ran launch games/mygame

# run a specific command
ran cmd debug games/mygame --background

# list all apps
ran app list

# edit an app definition
ran app edit games/mygame
```

you can use `ran help [command]` to learn more about a specific command.

## editing configuration and apps

ran automatically uses:

1. `$EDITOR` or `$VISUAL` environment variable if set
2. OS-wide preferred application for `.toml` files
3. fallback to `nano` (unix) or `notepad` (windows)

for editing config or app definition files.

to edit an app definition:

```bash
ran app edit <query>
```

to edit the config file:

```bash
ran config edit
```
